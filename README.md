# Pale Fire - Intelligent Knowledge Graph Search System
This framework is being developed by [Slava Tykhonov](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vyacheslavtikhonov/) and highly experimental.

> Named after Vladimir Nabokov's novel ["Pale Fire"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pale_Fire), where a poem becomes the subject of extensive commentary and interpretation—just like how this system builds a rich knowledge graph from text and enables intelligent exploration through questions. 

"The novel is presented as a 999-line poem, written by the fictional poet John Shade, with a foreword, lengthy commentary, and index written by Shade's neighbor and academic colleague, Charles Kinbote. Together these elements form a narrative in which both fictional authors are central characters. Pale Fire's unusual structure has attracted much attention, and it is often cited as an important example of metafiction, as well as an analog precursor to hypertext fiction, and a poioumenon."

## Example

Pale Fire can transform factually correct and evidence-confirmed data points from research datasets into human-readable descriptions based on annotations created by querying knowledge graphs on event entities and LLM integration of new knowledge into understandable narratives. In opposite, it can turn back any human-readable annotation to factually correct data points and link the provenance information as reference.

**Use Case Example**: If you have data observations on strikes registered on a specific date and place, Pale Fire can:

- Query the knowledge graph for related entities (location, date, event type)
- Retrieve contextual information such as weather conditions and temperature from connected nodes
- Find evidence from witnesses and related sources
- Synthesize all this information into a coherent, human-readable narrative

For instance, given a data point like:
```
Event: Strike
Date: March 15, 2023
Location: San Francisco, CA
```

Pale Fire can generate a narrative that includes:
- Historical weather data for that date and location
- Temperature records and conditions
- Related witness accounts or news reports
- Contextual information about similar events
- Temporal relationships to other events in the knowledge graph

**Example Narrative Output**:

> On March 15, 2023, a labor strike occurred in San Francisco, California. The day was characterized by mild spring weather, with temperatures reaching 62°F (17°C) and partly cloudy conditions—typical for early spring in the Bay Area. According to weather records, the morning began with light fog that cleared by mid-day, providing clear visibility for the demonstration that took place in the city's financial district.
>
> Witness accounts from local news reports indicate that approximately 500 workers gathered outside the headquarters of a major tech company, carrying signs and chanting demands for better working conditions. The strike was part of a broader wave of labor actions that had been occurring across California's tech sector throughout early 2023, following similar events in Los Angeles on March 8th and Oakland on March 12th.
>
> This event was temporally connected to a series of related labor actions: it occurred just one week after a similar strike in Seattle, Washington, and preceded another major demonstration in San Jose scheduled for March 22nd. The knowledge graph reveals that these events were part of a coordinated effort by tech workers' unions across the West Coast, responding to industry-wide concerns about workplace safety and compensation.
>
> Historical context from the knowledge graph shows that San Francisco has a long history of labor activism, with notable strikes occurring in 2018 and 2020. The 2023 strike shares similar characteristics with these previous events, particularly in terms of location (financial district) and participant demographics (tech sector workers).

This transforms raw data points into rich, contextualized stories that are both factually accurate and humanly comprehensible.

## 5-Factor Ranking System

Pale Fire combines 5 independent factors for optimal search results:

1. **Semantic Relevance** (30%) - RRF hybrid search (vector + keyword)
2. **Connectivity** (15%) - How well-connected in the knowledge graph
3. **Temporal Match** (20%) - Active during query time period
4. **Query Term Match** (20%) - Explicit matches of query terms
5. **Entity Type Match** (15%) - Entity types relevant to question type

## Question Types

| Type | Pattern | Boosts | Example |
|------|---------|--------|---------|
| WHO | who, whom, whose | PER (2.0x) | "Who was the AG?" |
| WHERE | where, which place | LOC (2.0x) | "Where did she work?" |
| WHEN | when, what year | DATE (2.0x) | "When was he governor?" |
| WHAT (org) | what organization | ORG (2.0x) | "What organization?" |
| WHAT (position) | what position | PER/ORG (1.5x) | "What position?" |
| HOW MANY | how many | CARDINAL (2.0x) | "How many years?" |
| WHY | why | EVENT (1.5x) | "Why did she leave?" |
| WHAT (event) | what happened | EVENT (2.0x) | "What happened?" |

```

## Best Practices

1. ✅ **Use AI Agent Daemon** for production - eliminates model loading delays
2. ✅ Use NER enrichment for production
3. ✅ Use question-aware search for natural questions
4. ✅ Batch process large datasets
5. ✅ Monitor logs for errors
6. ✅ Backup Neo4j database regularly
7. ✅ **Keep daemon running** - models stay loaded, requests are instant
8. ✅ **Parse files once** - reuse parsed text for multiple operations
9. ✅ Use appropriate parsers - PDF parsers vary in speed (pdfplumber slower but better)

## AI Agent Daemon

The AI Agent daemon keeps Gensim and spaCy models loaded in memory to avoid start/stop delays. This is especially useful for production deployments with high request volumes.

### Features

- **⚡ Fast Access**: Models stay loaded, eliminating 5-10 second initialization delays
- **🔄 Thread-Safe**: Safe concurrent access to models via ModelManager
- **📄 File Parsing**: Integrated parsers for TXT, CSV, PDF, and spreadsheet files
- **🔑 Keyword Extraction**: Fast keyword and n-gram extraction with configurable methods
- **🏷️ Entity Extraction**: Instant NER extraction using loaded spaCy models
- **📊 Status Monitoring**: Real-time status with process information (PID, memory, CPU)

### Quick Start

```bash
# Start daemon in background
python palefire-cli.py agent start --daemon

# Check status (shows PID, memory, CPU usage)
python palefire-cli.py agent status

# Stop daemon
python palefire-cli.py agent stop

# Restart daemon
python palefire-cli.py agent restart --daemon
```

### Using the Daemon Programmatically

```python
from agents import get_daemon

# Get daemon instance (models loaded once)
daemon = get_daemon(use_spacy=True)
daemon.model_manager.initialize(use_spacy=True)

# Extract keywords (fast - models already loaded)
keywords = daemon.extract_keywords(
    "Your text here",
    num_keywords=10,
    method='combined',
    enable_ngrams=True,
    min_ngram=2,
    max_ngram=3
)

# Extract entities (fast - models already loaded)
entities = daemon.extract_entities("Your text here")

# Parse files
result = daemon.parse_file("document.pdf")
if result['success']:
    text = result['text']
    metadata = result['metadata']
```

### Automatic Daemon Management

The `keywords` command automatically checks if the daemon is running and starts it if needed:

```bash
# This will start the daemon automatically if not running
python palefire-cli.py keywords "Your text here"
```

### Docker Deployment

**Standalone:**
```bash
# Start the AI Agent daemon
docker-compose -f agents/docker-compose.agent.yml up -d

# View logs
docker-compose -f agents/docker-compose.agent.yml logs -f

# Stop the agent
docker-compose -f agents/docker-compose.agent.yml down
```

**Integrated with main services:**
```bash
# Start all services including the agent
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f agents/docker-compose.agent.yml up -d
```

See **[agents/DOCKER.md](agents/DOCKER.md)** for complete Docker documentation.

See **[agents/USAGE_GUIDE.md](agents/USAGE_GUIDE.md)** for complete usage guide on starting, stopping, and querying the agent.

### System Service Integration

**Linux (systemd):**
```bash
# Copy service file
sudo cp agents/palefire-agent.service /etc/systemd/system/
# Edit paths in service file
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/palefire-agent.service
# Enable and start
sudo systemctl enable palefire-agent
sudo systemctl start palefire-agent
```

**macOS (launchd):**
```bash
# Copy plist file
cp agents/palefire-agent.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents/
# Edit paths in plist file
nano ~/Library/LaunchAgents/palefire-agent.plist
# Load service
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/palefire-agent.plist
```

### File Parsing Capabilities

The AI Agent includes integrated file parsers for extracting text from various formats:

- **TXT**: Plain text files with encoding detection
- **CSV**: Comma-separated values with delimiter auto-detection
- **PDF**: Text and table extraction (PyPDF2 or pdfplumber)
- **Spreadsheets**: Excel (.xlsx, .xls) and OpenDocument (.ods) with multi-sheet support

```python
from agents import get_daemon

daemon = get_daemon()
result = daemon.parse_file("document.pdf", max_pages=10)

# Result structure:
# {
#     'text': 'Full extracted text...',
#     'metadata': {'filename': 'document.pdf', 'page_count': 5, ...},
#     'pages': ['Page 1 text...', 'Page 2 text...'],
#     'tables': [{'data': [...], 'headers': [...]}],
#     'success': True,
#     'error': None
# }
```

### Benefits

- **⚡ No Model Loading Delays**: Models stay in memory, ready for instant use (10-100x faster!)
